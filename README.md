## Projet description

The Pokedex web app has been created to serve as an information resource to any aspiring Pokemon Masters. Users can open the Pokedex and see a list of Pokemons displayed. They can then click on any Pokemon to make a modal popping up and show more information on the selected Pokemon. 

The objective of this project was to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery that loads data from an external API (using AJAX) to enable the viewing of data points in detail and based on user interaction, as well as using some Bootstrap functionalities for the UIs.

The Pokedex development can be breakdown in the five following points:

 - **Who** — For any Pokemon fans.
 - **What** — A web app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap, which loads data from an external API (using AJAX) and dynamically update the webpage content with the retrieved Pokemon information.
 - **When** — Whenever users of the Pokedex are interacting with the web app.
 - **Where** — The Pokedex is hosted on Github Pages (gh-pages) and the code is accessible on the Github repository of this project. 
 - **Why** — To provides a simple, easy-to-use and visually appealing web app for anyone who wishes to learn more about the Pokemons.


## Technical aspects


The Pokedex web app is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap, and is fed by an external API named [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). PokeAPI is a RESTful API linked to a database detailing everything about the Pokemons. The API documentation can be found [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).

The Pokedex is hosted on Github Pages (gh-pages) and the code is accessible on the Github repository of this project.
